This is version 0.1.2 of Erasm++, a library for runtime code generation,
instruction decoding, and lazy metaprogramming.

See INSTALL for system requirements and installation instructions.

A preliminary [online manual](http://nishiuramakoto.github.com/erasm-plusplus/) was uploaded.

Alternatively,a PDF manual was also prepared. Please see doc/manual.pdf for an 
off-line documentation.

Unfortunaly, both of them are merely "rough sketches" of the library,
and are far from complete.  I'm working on a better documentation, but if
you have a problem in building/installing/using the library, please
describe your problem in [wiki](https://github.com/nishiuramakoto/erasm-plusplus/wiki)
or contact [me](nishiuramakoto@gmail.com). Thanks!
