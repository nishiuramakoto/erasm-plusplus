SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
------------------

We have tested the library on following systems and compilers:

Debian Testing(squeeze) running on Intel Celeron M 1.3GHz,
g++ version 4.5.3.

Windows 7 32-bit running on Intel Pentium Dual Core 2.4GHz,
mingw g++ version 4.5.4.

On 32-bit systems,g++ 4.6.1 won't pass 'make check'. See README for the
detail.

cl.exe bundled with Visual C++ 2011 Express looks fine,but not tested 
thoroughly yet.

Please report if you have succeeded or failed to build and use ERASM++ on
other systems.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

ERASM++ requires:

* GNU Autotools
* Boost static assert
* Boost stdint 
 (ERASM++ assumes the availability of 8-,16-,32-,and 64-bit integers)
* Boost preprocessor

Check out http://www.boost.org and install above libraries.

Additionally, we use "#pragma pack" for struct packing.If your compiler
doesn't support this,please let us know.

Furthermore,the following additional requirements must be met in order to
pass 'make check':

* GoogleTest
* GHC >= 7.0.3
* parsec,uulib,HUnit,QuickCheck >=2.4,HaskellForMaths >=0.4.0,fgl 
  all of which are available through 'cabal install'.

(In order to ensure maximum cross-compiler portability,should we switch to
other build systems? like cmake? boost's?)


INSTALLATION
------------
./configure --prefix=your-private-directory
make
make install

This will install the necessary headers under PREFIX/include/erasm,
and libraries under PREFIX/lib/erasm.

We don't recommend installing on the system directories,as ERASM++ is still
in its alpha stage.
